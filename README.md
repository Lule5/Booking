# Booking

## Project Description

The Booking project was developed as part of a university course requirement. This application manages apartments bookings, allowing users to view and make reservations. The user must first log in to access the application. Once logged in, they can see their past bookings and select cities from a combo box to view available apartments in that city. Users can then select an apartment, choose a reservation date, and complete the booking process.
